Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

This function:

Prompts the user to input the student's marks. Validates that the input is a number between 0 and 100. Determines the grade based on the input marks. Prints the grade to the console.

Challenge 2: (Speed Detector)

function checkSpeed() {} //This is a function declaration

//This prompts the user to enter the speed let speed = prompt("Enter the speed of the car (km/s):"); speed = parseInt(speed);

// This checks the values keyed in if (isNaN(speed) || speed < 0) { console.log("Invalid input. Please enter a valid speed."); return; }

//This line calculates the speed limit, points demerits returns the value after being invoked. const speedLimit = 70; const kmPerDemeritPoint = 5;

if (speed < speedLimit) {
    console.log("Ok");
} else {
    let demeritPoints = Math.floor((speed - speedLimit) / kmPerDemeritPoint);
    console.log("Demerit points: " + demeritPoints);
}
}

checkSpeed();

Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

//NSSF

NSSF calculation takes 6% of the basic salary and returns the minimum value between the returned value and 1080.
//NHIF 2. NHIF calculations uses classes of salaries. We therefore use the if ..else logical expressions to get the correct value.

//PAYE

For the correct amount we still get the correct value by taking (basic salary-NSSF) then multiplying by the correct progressive tax rate. if ..else operator is also used.
Net Salary is obtained by taking Basic salary-(NHIF+ PAYE+ NSSF)
